## How to use configuration variations

Open the ML4W dotfiles settings app via the ML4W Welcome App, the application launcher or the wheel icon in Waybar.

You can find several variation within the three settings pages.

- Monitor (Screen Resolutions)
- Animations
- Keybindings
- Windows 
- Window Rules
- Decorations
- Environments

Select the variation that you want to use from the corresponding drop down menu.

Please don't edit the shipped configuration variations. These will be overwritten with every update of the ML4W dotfiles. <b>Create your own custom variation instead.</b>

## Create your own variation

Open the ML4W dotfiles settings app via the ML4W Welcome App, the application launcher or the wheel icon in Waybar.

Select "Open Variation Folder" from the variation context menu.
